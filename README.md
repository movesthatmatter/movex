## üßê Why Movex

__Movex cuts your development effort in half and helps you ship faster by abstracting away backend logic and server-side complexity! üéâ__

With its unique approach and robust set of features, Movex gives you the freedom to focus solely on the front-end while still maintaining full control over the Game Logic, UI/UX, and Data Authority.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features:
- __Serverless:__
  Movex manages the network logic, state-sharing protocols, server deployment and maintenance, along with various other essential functionalities. [Learn more](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/serverless).
- __Authoritative Server:__
  By keeping the data reconciliation logic on the server side, Movex keeps bad actors away, ensuring the integrity of your application. [Learn more](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/server_authoritative).
- __Real-time synchronization:__
  By utilizing the Observable Pattern to monitor state changes in registered resources Movex promptly notifes the UI layer. [See more](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/realtime)
- __Private State:__
  Movex allows parts of the shared state to remain private to specific users, ensuring that sensitive information is kept secure. [See more](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/private_state)
- __Efficient Data Flow:__
  Movex ensures that only the minimum required data is transmitted with each update, optimizing performance. (See: [Deterministic Action Propagation](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/functional#determinstic-action-propagation))

## üßôüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How Movex works
Movex follows the [Flux Pattern](https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/flux-pattern-architecture-in-react-35d0b55313f6) locally to respond to UI changes. It then employs the [Deterministic Propagation Method](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/functional#determinstic-action-propagation) to synchronize state changes with the Global State(aka Master State) and all peers in the network. [Learn More](https://www.movex.dev/docs/how).
