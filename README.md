## 🧐 Why Movex

__Movex let's you cut the development effort in half and ship faster by abstracting the backend logic and server-side away! 🎉__

With it's unique approach and set of features Movex gives you the freedom to focus only on the front-end while still maintaining all of the control over the App Logic, UI/UX and Authority over Data.

In addition it comes pre-packed with:
- the ability to keep parts of the shared state private to specific users. [See Secret State](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/secret_state)
- ensures the minimun amount of data is sent over the wire with each update. [See Deterministic Action Propagation](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/functional)
- keeps bad actors away by keeping the Data Reconciliation Logic out of the client reach. [See Authoritative Server](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/server_authoritative)

## 🧙🏽‍♂️ How Movex works

At the client level, Movex adheres to the [Flux Pattern](https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/flux-pattern-architecture-in-react-35d0b55313f6) to react to UI changes. Additionally, it employs the ["Deterministic Action Propagation Method"](https://www.movex.dev/docs/features/functional#determinstic-action-propagation) to synchronize any state changes with the Global (Master) State which lives on the server. Consequently, this process instantly updates all other peers on the network, ensuring real-time data synchronization. [Learn More](https://www.movex.dev/docs/how).
